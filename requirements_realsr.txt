# Real-SR Professional Upscaling - Heavy Dependencies
# WARNING: This requires PyTorch, torchvision, and OpenCV
# May not work on all Android/Termux setups due to size and compatibility

# Core requirements first
-r requirements.txt

# PyTorch (CPU version for mobile compatibility)
# Choose ONE of these PyTorch options:

# Option 1: Latest PyTorch CPU (recommended for desktop)
torch>=1.7.0,<2.0.0
torchvision>=0.8.0,<1.0.0

# Option 2: Lighter PyTorch for mobile (uncomment if above fails)
# torch==1.13.1+cpu
# torchvision==0.14.1+cpu

# Option 3: Even lighter for very constrained systems (uncomment if needed)
# torch==1.11.0+cpu
# torchvision==0.12.0+cpu

# Real-SR components (require PyTorch)
realesrgan==0.3.0
basicsr==1.4.2

# Additional ML dependencies
facexlib>=0.2.5
gfpgan>=1.3.5
tqdm

# Note: This setup requires ~2-3GB of dependencies
# For mobile/Android, consider using API-based upscaling instead
